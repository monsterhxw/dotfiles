description: Generate a git commit
model: haiku

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Your task is to help the user to generate a commit message and commit the changes using git.

### Guidelines

- DO NOT add any ads such as "Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)"
- Only generate the message for staged files/changes
- Don't add any files using `git add`. The user will decide what to add. 
- Follow the rules below for the commit message.

### Format

```
<type>:<space><message title>

<bullet points summarizing what was updated>
```

### Example Titles

```
feat(auth): add JWT login flow
fix(ui): handle null pointer in sidebar
refactor(api): split user controller logic
docs(readme): add usage section
```

### Example with Title and Body

```
feat(auth): add JWT login flow

- Implemented JWT token validation logic
- Added documentation for the validation component
```

### Rules

* title is lowercase, no period at the end.
* Title should be a clear summary, max 50 characters.
* Use the body (optional) to explain *why*, not just *what*.
* Bullet points should be concise and high-level.

Avoid

* Vague titles like: "update", "fix stuff"
* Overly long or unfocused titles
* Excessive detail in bullet points
